# Ames Housing Data

**Note:** Project is incomplete, moved from incorrectly stored data science projects repo

## Objective: 

Create a Regression Model to predict housing price based on a house's features. This model will be used to estimate market value based on features of a house, such as number of bedrooms and location, which will be useful for users who are shopping for a house when negotiating price. Performance will be measured by difference between model prediction and actual house price.
